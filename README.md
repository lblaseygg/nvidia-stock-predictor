# NVIDIA Stock Price Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts NVIDIA stock prices using historical data and sentiment analysis from news articles.

## Project Overview

This project combines traditional stock price analysis with sentiment analysis from news articles to predict NVIDIA's stock price movements. The system uses multiple machine learning models and provides a web interface for visualization and predictions.

## Features

- Historical stock data analysis
- News article scraping and sentiment analysis
- Multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest/XGBoost, LSTM)
- Feature engineering with technical indicators
- Web interface for visualization
- Automated updates and model retraining

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nvidia-stock-predictor.git
cd nvidia-stock-predictor
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Data Collection:
   - Historical stock data will be automatically downloaded
   - News articles will be scraped from configured sources

2. Model Training:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

3. Run the Web Interface:
```bash
python app.py
```

## Model Details

The project implements three different machine learning approaches:

1. **Linear Regression**: Baseline model for price prediction
2. **Random Forest/XGBoost**: Advanced ensemble methods for better accuracy
3. **LSTM**: Deep learning approach for time series prediction
